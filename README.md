# ENSIAS-FORCE

Mobile application with Android-java to share clean code and great ideas between ENSIAS students and laureats.
Its a solution that we adopted to attract laureats to use our plateform. Using this mobile application laureats can see all students ideas so that they will share knowledge by giving advices to students. Its also a way to have a database of projects that are developed by students.
